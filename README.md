simple-e2-theft-protection
==========================

This is a very simple script that prevents several ways admins can steal users' E2s. Install this on your server if you don't trust your admins.

You can verify that the server has it installed by typing "wire_expression2_theft_protection" into the console and seeing if the console's autocomplete feature starts filling it in for you.

The options are:
* 0 = Disabled. Everyone can steal your E2s if the prop protection mod allows it.
* 1 = Enabled. Only people on your Prop Protection friends list can take your code. (NOTE: Some prop protection mods will add all admins to your PP friends list at all times)
* 2 = Enabled. Only super admins can take your code. (DEFAULT MODE)
* 3 = Enabled. Nobody can take your code (except admins with access to Lua commands, they still can).

There's no licence, do whatever the hell you want with it.
